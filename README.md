Plus, just a little thinking...
Taking the letters SBC as: Single Board Computing Device, instead of the original "single board computer" meaning...

Two reasons:
1) To distance it from the traditional (mainframe) "computer" notion...
2) To, also, distance it from the desktop/notebook "personal computer" notion...

Since words shape mental images, and mental images can influence thinking, the use of an old term/word can hold back the creative thinking necessary for the full exploration of the SBC potential, which, in my opinion goes way beyond the "computer" and way beyond the desktop computer...
